--DROP VIEW admin.v_generate_tbl_ddl;
/**********************************************************************************************
Purpose: View to get the DDL for a table.  This will contain the distkey, sortkey, constraints,
         not null, defaults, etc.

Notes:   Default view ordering causes foreign keys to be created at the end.
         This is needed due to dependencies of the foreign key constraint and the tables it
         links.  Due to this one should not manually order the output if you are expecting to
         be able to replay the SQL directly from the VIEW query result. It is still possible to
         order if you filter out the FOREIGN KEYS and then apply them later.

         The following filters are useful:
           where ddl not like 'ALTER TABLE %'  -- do not return FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
           where ddl like 'ALTER TABLE %'      -- only get FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
           where tablename in ('t1', 't2')     -- only get DDL for specific tables
           where schemaname in ('s1', 's2')    -- only get DDL for specific schemas

         So for example if you want to order DDL on tablename and only want the tables 't1', 't2'
         and 't4' you can do so by using a query like:
           select ddl from (
             (
               select
                 *
               from admin.v_generate_tbl_ddl
               where ddl not like 'ALTER TABLE %'
               order by tablename
             )
             UNION ALL
             (
               select
                 *
               from admin.v_generate_tbl_ddl
               where ddl like 'ALTER TABLE %'
               order by tablename
             )
           ) where tablename in ('t1', 't2', 't4');

History:
2014-02-10 jjschmit Created
2015-05-18 ericfe Added support for Interleaved sortkey
2015-10-31 ericfe Added cast tp increase size of returning constraint name
2016-05-24 chriz-bigdata Added support for BACKUP NO tables
2017-05-03 pvbouwel Change table & schemaname of Foreign key constraints to allow for filters
2018-01-15 pvbouwel Add QUOTE_IDENT for identifiers (schema,table and column names)
2018-05-30 adedotua Add table_id column
2018-05-30 adedotua Added ENCODE RAW keyword for non compressed columns (Issue #308)
2018-10-12 dmenin Added table ownership to the script (as an alter table statment as the owner of the table is the issuer of the CREATE TABLE command)
